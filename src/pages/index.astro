        I am a final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge where I am completing my thesis on "Robust Understanding of Task-Oriented Dialogues". 
        A keen engineer and researcher, I am interested in building systems that can understand and reason about the world, with the focust on development of 
        intelligent agents capable of adapting to their user and open-ended environments. Other areas of interest include robustness and uncertainty in large language models, 
        planning for complex tasks, symbolic reasoning and technical AI safety.

    title="ASPERA: A Simulated Environment to Evaluate Planning for Complex Action Execution"
    img="/aspera.png"
    desc="As part of my research internship hosted by the Siri Understanding team at Apple, I conducted an intial evaluation of
     the ability of large language models to carry out complex tasks on behalf of users when given access to their digital context. 
     The evaluation relies on a simulated execution environment equipped with functional outcome validation and data generation 
     capabilities. Initial evaluation results on a benchmark of 250 complex tasks have been presented in Vienna at ACL 2025."

    title="Programmable Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems with Execution and Policy Feedback"
    img="/pytod.png"
    desc="Task-oriented dialogue agents provide natural language interfaces which enable seamless interaction between users and web- or mobile based applications. A highly 
    accurate estimation of the relevant task information provided by the user is crucial for the success of the dialogue system. However, state-of-the-art research systems 
    often model state estimation in isolation, without considering user interaction policy and the environment where the dialogue system operates. As part of my research internship 
    hosted by the Siri Understanding team at Apple, I explored symbolic reasoning techniques which enable seamless integration of feedback from execution and policy into the state estimation 
    process. This enables very small language models to self-correct their errors or to efficiently commmunicate with larger models, ultimately resulting in improved state estimation robustness and accuracy 
    as the convesation progresses. (Image credit: Seldon.io)"

    desc="Alibi is a source-available Python library aimed at machine learning model inspection and interpretation. The focus of the library is to provide high-quality implementations 
    of black-box, white-box, local and global explanation methods for classification and regression models. As a research engineer at Seldon, I was one of the main contributiors, integrating, documenting and improving 
    algorithms such as SHAP and Anchor Explanations."
