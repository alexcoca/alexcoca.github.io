        I am a final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, completing my thesis on "Robust Understanding of Task-Oriented Dialogues". A keen engineer and researcher, I am interested in building systems that can understand and reason about the world, with the focus on developing intelligent agents capable of adapting to their users and open-ended environments. Other interests include robustness and uncertainty in large language models, planning for complex tasks, symbolic reasoning and technical AI safety.
