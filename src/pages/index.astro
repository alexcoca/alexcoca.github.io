        I am a final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, completing my thesis on "Robust Understanding of Task-Oriented Dialogues". 
        A keen engineer and researcher, I am interested in building systems that can understand and reason about the world, with focused on developing 
        intelligent agents capable of adapting to their users and open-ended environments. Other interests include robustness and uncertainty in large language models, 
        planning for complex tasks, symbolic reasoning and technical AI safety.

    title="ASPERA: A Simulated Environment to Evaluate Planning for Complex Action Execution"
    img="/aspera.png"
    desc="As part of my research internship with Apple's Siri Understanding team, I conducted an initial evaluation of
     large language models' ability to carry out complex tasks on behalf of users when given access to their digital context. 
     The evaluation uses a simulated execution environment with functional outcome validation and data generation 
     capabilities. Results on a benchmark of 250 complex tasks were presented at ACL 2025 in Vienna."

    title="Programmable Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems with Execution and Policy Feedback"
    img="/pytod2.png"
    desc="Task-oriented dialogue agents provide natural language interfaces for web and mobile applications. Accurate estimation of user-provided task information is crucial for dialogue system success. 
    However, state-of-the-art systems often model state estimation in isolation, without considering user interaction policy and operating environment. During my research internship 
    with Apple's Siri Understanding team, I explored symbolic reasoning techniques that integrate feedback from execution and policy into state estimation. 
    This enables smaller language models to self-correct errors or efficiently communicate with larger models to do so, improving state estimation robustness and accuracy 
    as conversations progress."

    desc="Alibi is a source-available Python library for machine learning model inspection and interpretation. The library provides high-quality implementations 
    of black-box, white-box, local and global explanation methods for classification and regression models. As a research engineer at Seldon, I was one of the main contributors, integrating, documenting and improving 
    algorithms such as SHAP and Anchor Explanations."
